Introduction
------------

At CERN, we use GitLab to host our code. GitLab is bundled with a built-in CI/CD system that we'll learn how to develop on to make our code robust to errors, preserved, and reproducible.

The aim of this module is to:
- explore what it means to build a CI/CD workflow
- expand on concepts unique to GitLab's CI/CD which is essential to anyone working in ATLAS

> ## The skills we'll focus on:
>
> 1.  Making scripts exit correctly
> 2.  Building a CI/CD workflow of unlimited potential
> 3.  Understanding how job runners work (and get access to your clones)
> 4.  The GitLab permissions model
> 5.  Protecting secret information while allowing jobs to run
